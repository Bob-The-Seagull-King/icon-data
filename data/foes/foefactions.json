There are many biologists and naturalists across Arden Eld undertaking the hard work of categorizing the dizzying number of species that are found every week by intrepid adventurers. Many beast organs and excretions are extremely useful in medicine, research, industry, and even cosmetics, and teams of hunters are often sent out to bag a particularly beast once its kind are sighted."

Life in the villages is hard work but generally pleasant, and organized around the yearly harvests. Neighboring villages tend to depend on each other for trade, safety, and information, and come together for festivals (of which there are many, especially in the summer months). The villages typically are run by a city elder, or a council of elders and have a strong connection to nature and its cycles. Faithful villagers tend to pay their respects to the local nature spirits or the Titans at shrines or holy sites such as pools or groves."
